# Data Science Portfolio

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Amy's Github Page ðŸ˜„

This is my portfolio of data science projects written by me for academic, personal interests and self-learning purpose. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files. 

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

  - [Health status classification]: A model that performs multiclass classification prediction using various clsssification models including random forecast, logistic regression models, xgboost. 
  
    _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib_

- ### R
  
  - [Time Series Forecasting](https://rpubs.com/amyxcyyy/TimeSeries): Use some basic forecasting models such as ARIMA and SARIMA model and analyze seasonality and trend within the time series data. 
  
  - [House price prediction](https://rpubs.com/amyxcyyy/HousePricePrediction): Create a linear model and analyze the correlation within the dataset. Find variables that has strong correlation with the house price and build linear model to do the prediction.
